            "EDUGENIE: Cellular respiration is how cells produce energy by breaking down glucose (sugar) from food into water and carbon dioxide. This happens in three stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain. During glycolysis, one molecule of glucose is split into two molecules of pyruvate. In the citric acid cycle, these pyruvates are further broken down to release more energy. Finally, in the electron transport chain, electrons from the pyruvates flow through a series of protein complexes, releasing energy that powers the production of ATP (energy molecules). The carbon dioxide produced is released into the air as a waste product.\n",

            "EDUGENIE: The Roman Empire was one of the largest empires in history, which existed from 27 BC to 476 AD. It started as the Roman Republic, but later became an empire ruled by emperors. The Romans were known for their impressive architecture, including buildings like the Colosseum and aqueducts, which brought water into cities. They also had a powerful army and conquered much of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. However, the empire eventually declined due to various factors such as economic troubles, military defeats, and political instability.\n",

In contrast, a democracy is a system where citizens have direct participation in decision-making through voting and other forms of political engagement. The key distinction between these two systems lies in the distribution of power - while a republic concentrates it among a few individuals, a democracy disperses it across the entire population.\n",
